                    VM202 is a plasmid DNA that contains novel genomic cDNA hybrid human hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)
                    coding sequence (HGF-X7) expressing two isoforms of HGF, HGF728 and HGF723.
                </p>
                <p>
                    HGF-X7 was designed by inserting a series of intron sequences into certain sites of HGF cDNA so that
                    both isoforms of HGF protein are expressed simultaneously and efficiently as in the human genome.
                    Because there is no change in the coding region of the gene, HGF proteins generated from VM202 are
                    identical to the wild-type human HGF proteins.

                    VM202 more efficiently induced migration of human umbilical vein endothelial cells and C2C12 cells
                    when compared to DNAs expressing either of two isoforms, and it also improved cardiac function in a
                    rat ischemic heart disease model more efficiently than an identical vector expressing only HGF728.
                    Consistent with these preclinical data, an open label phase I/II study and a randomized double-blind
                    phase II study in painful DPN, as well as a phase I/II trial and a phase II trial for critical limb
                    ischemia all showed that VM202 is safe and well tolerated.

                    VM202 is the only plasmid DNA-based biopharmaceutical that simultaneously produces high levels of
                    two isoforms of hepatocyte growth factor—HGF728 and HGF723. The simultaneously expressed both
                    isoforms of HGF then bind to the c-Met receptor, inducing multiple bioactivities that include the
                    formation of new blood vessels, nerve regeneration, suppression of pain-related factors, and
                    amelioration of amytrophic condition.

                    Diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) is one of the most commonly encountered neuropathic pain
                    syndromes in clinical practice, and is a particularly debilitating complication of diabetes.
                    Characteristically, the pain is burning, lancinating, tingling, or shooting (electric shock–like);
                    occurs with paresthesia; presents in varying combinations; and is typically worse at night.
                </p>
                <p>
                    About 30 million US adults have diabetes1 and about 50% of diabetics will eventually develop some
                    form of diabetic neuropathy2 over their life time. Among them, about 3-4 million patients are
                    estimated to have painful DPN3. Total annual direct medical costs for patients with DPN were
                    significantly higher than patients with diabetes only4, and if current health trends persist
                    unabated, the costs associated with diabetic neuropathy will rise sharply over the coming decades.
                    Currently, there are no approved drugs or interventional strategies known to halt or reverse the
                    progression of DPN.

                    Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is a progressive disease that obstructs the blood supply to the
                    lower limbs. Generally, ulcers initially occur due to trauma, pressure loading, and/or neuropathy,
                    many of which tend to be unresponsive to standard therapies, persist despite appropriate care, and
                    become chronic. Diabetes and PAD are often intertwined conditions: the likelihood of developing PAD
                    increases with diabetes. Independently, either disease process can result in compromised mobility
                    and susceptibility to peripheral tissue damage which can then progress to non-healing foot ulcers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Over 6.5 million people in the US alone have chronic, non-healing foot ulcers and most patients have
                    some form of peripheral neuropathy. The lifetime risk of being affected by the condition is
                    estimated at between 19% and 34% of diabetics, while roughly 40% of patients have a recurrence
                    within 1 year after ulcer healing, almost 60% within 3 years, and 65% within 5 years1. The chance of
                    developing an ulcer doubles in patients with concomitant PAD. Current treatment strategies result in
                    healing approximately 50% of ulcers, regardless of underlying comorbidities, but most ulcers recur
                    while 25% of open wounds progress to gangrene or enlarge to such an extent that they require
                    amputation. The risk of death at 5 years for a patient with a diabetic foot ulcer is 2.5 times as
                    high as the risk for a patient with diabetes without a foot ulcer4. This significant and growing
                    public health concern costs the US healthcare system over $25 billion annually without accounting
                    for productivity loss.

                    VM202 is currently under development targeting chronic diabetic foot ulcer and plans to approach as
                    a fundamental treatment that can heal the ulcer by supplying sufficient blood through blood vessel
                    formation into the ulcer area at the lower extremities. We have confirmed safe and effective ulcer
                    healing in the VM202-PAD phase II study. The development of new blood vessels around the occluded
                    arteries would improve blood flow to the affected areas, which leads to increased perfusion and
                    wound healing.

                    HGF can function as a neurotrophic factor. When VM202 is injected along the peripheral nerves and
                    their branches, the localized production of HGF resulting from VM202 injection may protect nerves
                    and promote the growth of neurons while also ameliorating atrophic conditions.

                    Using this function, VM202 is being developed to target amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, a
                    neurodegenerative disease. The condition is characterized by the destruction of motor neurons
                    necessary for the mobility muscle group such as tongue, neck, limbs, in many cases without a known
                    cause. ASL prevalence in the US is about 5 per 100,000 people.

                    Ischemic heart disease (IHD), generally known as coronary artery disease (CAD), occurs when one or
                    more of the coronary arteries are narrowed or occluded, resulting in the decrease of blood supply to
                    the heart muscle. It is one of the third leading cause of death worldwide. The most effective
                    treatment options are known to be the use of drugs such as anti-thrombotic agents or anti-ischemic
                    agents and surgical procedures like percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or coronary artery
                    bypass graft surgery (CABG) applied in case of severely narrowed or obstructed arteries. However,
                    the disease recurs to 30% of the patients who have had a successful surgery, while about 10% of the
                    patient population do not respond to medication and cannot receive surgery.

                    Therapeutic angiogenesis using hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) promotes the proliferation and
                    migration of vascular endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells, by which blood vessel formation may
                    be possible in the ischemic area. It has also been reported that HGF-based angiogenesis has
                    advantage in cardiac muscle function improvement through the suppression of apoptosis and cardiac
                    fibrosis following myocardial infarction, a form of IHD.
